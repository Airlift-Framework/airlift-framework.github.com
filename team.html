      <strong>Substance</strong> is being developed by a bunch of <a href="https://github.com/substance?tab=members">volunteers</a> who got excited about the idea. They started contributing one day and haven't stopped.

        Michael is obsessed with the idea of open digital publishing by considering content as data and separating it from presentation. Back in 2010 he kicked off Substance in order to verify that idea. This verification is still in progress.

        Has been around doing web development for "the evil" in the 00s, became really passionate about digital communication but got rapidly tired of <a href="http://strand.bandcamp.com/track/racing-for-bucks">racing for the bucks</a>. Nowadays trying to get involved with the stuff that matters, like clapping off-beat, meeting people and Open Source.

        Oliver has worked in various fields of Computer Science. He loves code generation, parsers and lately, Javascript. Back in 2010, he helped with the initial design of the Substance Document Model. Now he's working on our native Substance Builds (OSX and Linux), and our new DocumentStore interface which is exposed to Javascript.

        Tim joined the project in Summer 2011. He's the one responsible for integrating <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a> with Substance Letterpress, so we can turn Substance documents into LaTeX, Markdown, Textile and many other formats.

        Currently he is exploring the posibilities of <a href="http://ot.substance.io">Operational Transformation</a> and also writes lots of code in Haskell and Lua.

      <p>Eugen believes that storytelling is still the most effective way to emotionally impact people, and using the Internet as an engine of our collective efforts we can push forward and evolve our communities.

      <p>Since late 2005 he worked with digital tools (text/image editing, communication systems, data sharing) to enhance office productivity and collaboration. Learning and working with Web technologies have inspired him to develop more easier ways to share and publish information.
