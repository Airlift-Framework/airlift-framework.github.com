# Introduction
The Incoming module contains functions for processing incoming data. This includes data conversion and validation; data encryption, audit and persistence.

## - CreateKey (resourceName, guid)
Creates a com.google.appengine.api.datastore.Key via the KeyFactory.

    var in = require('airlift/incoming'), u = require('airlift/util');
    var key = in.createKey('person', u.guid(12));
    u.println(key.getName()); //c30215c36032
    
## - CreateEntity (resourceName, guid)
Creates a com.google.appengine.api.datastore.Entity.  Relies on createKey.

    var in = require('airlift/incoming'), u = require('airlift/util');
    var entity = in.createEntity('person', u.guid(12));
    u.println(entity.getKind()); //person
   
## - Bookkeeping (entity, userid, postDate, putDate)
Populates the entity object with the bookkeeping metadata that describes when this object was created and by whom it was created.  If userId is not provided and cannot be determined systematically 'user id not provided' is recorded.  If postDate is not provided the current date and time is used instead.  If putDate is not provided the postDate is used instead.

    var in = require('airlift/incoming'), u = require('airlift/util');
    var person = in.createEntity('person', u.guid(12));
    in.bookkeeping(person, 'bediako', u.createDate());
