## Less noise
The Collection module contains handy functions developers can use to traverse a JavaScript array, or a Java ArrayList or Java Set in a similar manner.

# Substance API

Substance is exposing a simple API so you can process Substance documents in your own application.

Here's what you can do:

- Create a publication programatically: The document will show up at Substance.io
- Update an existing publication with new content
- Search for documents
- Delete a document or specific version
- Create a new user at Substance.io
- Update user details
