# The Substance Composer

Below you can see the lastest dev-build of the **Substance** application. We're working out the kinks to provide you with a solid release as soon as possible.

## Keyboard navigation

Not only Substance keeps the UI-noise as low as possible, it also can also controlled via keyboard. There are shortcuts for adding, moving and deleting content elements, as well as for working with annotations and comments.

## Fast

Substance is fast. With Substance all operations are performed locally, giving it a huge speed advantage on centralized systems that constantly have to communicate with a server somewhere. The Substance Composer applies operations locally first, then distributes the changes over the network.

## Secure

Documents are stored locally on your computer. They are safe and secure until you hit publish and replicate them with a trusted Substance Hub.

# Usage

While editing a document, if you ever want to see what's happening behind the curtain, just press `ctrl` + `alt` + `c` to open the Substance Console and inspect the document's operation history.

# Install (OSX)

## Prequesites

Make sure you have XCode and Macports or Homebrew installed. Then install some libraries:

	$ port install pcre cmake
or  

	$ brew install pcre cmake
    
## Clone repository

    $ git clone git@github.com:substance/composer.git
    $ cd composer

## Build externals

    $ mkdir build-ext
    $ cd build-ext
    $ cmake -DEXTERNALS_ONLY=ON ..
    $ make

## Build Substance Composer

    $ cd ..
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
	$ cmake ..
    $ make
    $ make install

## Enable Webkit Inspector

    $ defaults write quasipartikel.Substance WebKitDeveloperExtras -bool true


## Configure application

In order to use your own server (instead of Substance.io) you can overrule the Composer's settings by providing a config.json file in the root folder:
    
    {
      "hub": "http://localhost:3000",
      "hub_api": "http://localhost:3000/api/v1",
      "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
      "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
    }

## Run Application

    $ cd ..
    $ ./build/app/osx/Substance.app/Contents/MacOS/Substance
    
## Access Redis (In DEVMODE)

	$ ext/redisdb/bin/redis-cli

# License

The Substance Composer is released under the MIT license. We chose a very libaral license because we wanted to make it easy for you to use Substance in your environment and also get involved into the development.
