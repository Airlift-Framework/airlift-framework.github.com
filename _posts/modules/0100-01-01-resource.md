# Introduction
Airlift is a restful framework.  Resources are the center of Airlift application development.  When designing an application, developers are encouraged to create as many resources as they like.  The resource.js module contains functions that allow developers to traverse the application resources' attributes.  In Airlift a resource is represented as a simple JavaScript object ({}).

Whenever a iterative function is executed in resource, the iterator function that you provide is executed within a context that governs the traversal of that resource.  This context is set as the 'this' for the iterator function.  It makes available following:

* resourceName - the name of the resource being traversed.
* resourceMetadata - metadata describing the resource being traversed.  It contains a list of attributes this resource holds.
* attributesMetadata - metadata describing each individual attribute this resource holds.
* foreignKeys - a list of names of all the foreign keys in this resource.
* attributes - a list of names of all the attributes in this resource.
* web - a web object that gives access to the web context.  The web context contains information about the current request.
* report - a function used to report errors.
* allErrors - a function that returns all errors reported so far.
* getErrors - a function that returns all errors reported for a given attribute of this resource.

All iterative functions in resource.js allow for the replacement of any of the attributes of the context object by optionally providing an object at invocation time.

The functions available in this module are described below.

## Each - each (resourceName, resource, iterator, \[context\])
Iterates over a resource, yielding each in turn to an iterator function. The iterator is bound to the context object, if one is passed, along with the attributes provided in the default context. Each invocation of iterator is called with four arguments: (value, attributeName, resource, metadata).

### example
    var person = {fullName: 'Kwame Mtume', shortName: 'Kwame', age: 27};
    var lightPerson = {};
    var res = require('resource');
    var context = {attributes: ['shortName', 'age']}; //set to limit iteration 
    res.each('person', person, function(_value, _name, _resource, _metadata)
    {
       lightPerson[_name] = _value;
    } , context);
	util.println(JSON.stringify(lightPerson)); // {shortName: 'Kwame', age: 27 }

## Map - map (resourceName, resource, iterator, \[context\])
Iterates over a resource, yielding each in turn to an iterator function. The iterator is bound to the context object, if one is passed, along with the attributes provided in the default context. Each invocation of iterator is called with four arguments: (value, attributeName, resource, metadata).  The result of each iterator invocation is saved to a new resource object.

* resourceName - name of the resource
* resource - the simple JavaScript object containing the resource information.
* iterator - the function to be executed on each attribute resource.
* context - an optional context used to override any of the attributes of the this provided to the iterator function at runtime.
* return = a new resource object that contains the results for each invocation of the iterator function per attribute visited.
### example
    var person = {fullName: 'Kwame Mtume', shortName: 'Kwame', age: 27};
    var res = require('resource');
    var context = {attributes: ['shortName', 'age']}; //set to limit iteration 
    var lightPerson = res.map('person', person, function(_value, _name, _resource, _metadata)
    {
       return _value;
    } , context);
    util.println(JSON.stringify(lightPerson)); // {shortName: 'Kwame', age: 27 }
    
## Reduce - reduce (base, resourceName, resource, iterator, \[context\])
Iterates over a resource, yielding each in turn to an iterator function. The iterator is bound to the context object, if one is passed, along with the attributes provided in the default context. Each invocation of iterator is called with five arguments: (base, value, attributeName, resource, metadata).  The result of each iterator invocation replaces the base value.  Reduce returns the value of base at the end.

* resourceName - name of the resource
* resource - the simple JavaScript object containing the resource information.
* iterator - the function to be executed on each attribute resource.
* context - an optional context used to override any of the attributes of the this provided to the iterator function at runtime.
* return = a new resource object that contains the results for each invocation of the iterator function per attribute visited.
### example
    var person = {fullName: 'Kwame Mtume', shortName: 'Kwame', age: 27};
    var res = require('resource');
    var context = {attributes: ['shortName', 'age']}; //set to limit iteration
    var lightPerson = res.map('person', person, function(_value, _name, _resource, _metadata)
    {
       return _value;
    } , context);
    util.println(JSON.stringify(lightPerson)); // {shortName: 'Kwame', age: 27 }
