# This page is under construction!

We are currently working to make the demos available soon.  Thank you for your patience.

# Posting an Entity to the Datastore

1.  Copy the Airlift framework directory and rename it to example01 or any naming of your choice.
2.  Open the src/doc/app.dic file.  The example text included in the file describes four resources: a person, an order, an order line item, and a product.
3.  Let's add a resource to allow a person to register, or create an account for a web app.  This resource shall be called a registration.  Add the following text to the bottom of the app.dic file.


        A Registration
        has a full name
        has an email address
        has a mobile phone number which is not required
        has a "password"


4.  Create a POST.js handler for registration in war/WEB-INF/classes/handler.  Insert the following code:


        var util = require('airlift/util');
        exports.handle = function(_web)
        {
            var inc = require('airlift/incoming').create(_web);
            var res = require('airlift/resource').create(_web);
     
            res.each(_web.getResourceName(), {}, 
               res.sequence(inc.convert, inc.validate),
               function(_name, _resource) {
	        if (util.isEmpty(this.allErrors()) === true)
                {
	            var da = require('airlift/da/insert').create(_web);
	            da.insert(_web.getResourceName(), _resource);
	        }
            });
        };
