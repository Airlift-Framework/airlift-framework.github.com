# 1.0 Introduction

This page will be about getting started with Lucid Technic's Airlift.  We will begin by explaining some background on restful servers, web development and cloud infrastructures.  Then we will cover how to get Airlift running on your system and setup so that you can start working with it. At the end of this page you should understand what Airlift is capable of, why you should use it, and be ready to rapidly start your first Airlift application.

# 1.1 Cloud Computing

# A Brief History

# Airlift Concepts

# Installation

# Setting Up

# This page is under construction!

We are currently working to make the getting started page available soon.  Thank you for your patience.
