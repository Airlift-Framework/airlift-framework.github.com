# 1.0 Introduction

This page will be about getting started with Lucid Technic's Airlift.  We will begin by explaining some background on cloud computing and restful servers.  Then we will cover how to get Airlift running on your system and setup so that you can start working with it. At the end of this page you should understand what Airlift is capable of, why you should use it, and be ready to rapidly start your first Airlift application.

Airlift is Lucid Technics’ open source rapid web development framework designed to work with cloud infrastructures. We use Airlift to rapidly build secure and scalable cloud applications. Much of the software created using Airlift is generated from Dictation, Lucid Technics’ open source human readable business requirements language.

Using Dictation with Airlift, Lucid Technics can generate software to deliver many modes of business functionality that are often coded by hand. These include common application functionality such as data formatting, data conversion, and data validation. They also include more challenging application functionality, such as automatic data auditing, robust data encryption, user action undo and redo, and role based security.

Our advanced code generation apparatus enables Lucid Technics to rapidly stand up your web applications, thereby allowing us to spend less time on infrastructure code, and more time on your business workflow requirements.

# 1.4 Installation

Installing Airlift is simple.  You just need to copy the Airlift directory onto your local machine.  This should only take a few minutes.  But before you do that, be sure that your system meets the following requirements:

* [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/) (or [Java 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html) for Macs)
* [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/srcdownload.cgi)
* [Google App Engine SDK](https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Java)

All set?  Go ahead and download the zip file, and unzip it into whichever directory you so desire.
