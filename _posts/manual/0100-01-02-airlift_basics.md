# 2.0 Introduction

In Airlift Basics, we will walk you through the steps of startting and finishing an Airlift application.  We'll explain more about what's inside the Airlift environment and how it all works together.  This page will describe how to write your business logic in the app.dic file and your handlers, which are the only two documents that you need to worry about.  After the developer's part is written, we can move on to deploying your first Airlift hello world application.


# 2.1 The Airlift World

Airlift
  airlift
    dictate.js
    hack.js
    packages.js
    test.js

gen/meta/a gen/meta/r app.dic harness.js dictate.js
builds set "global" variables outside of build file then the build file uses them

<!--
A resource handle is an identifier for a resource that is currently being accessed. Resource handles can be opaque, in which case they are often integer numbers, or they can be pointers that allow access to further information. Common resource handles are file descriptors and sockets.

The concept of a web resource is primitive in the Web architecture, and is used in the definition of its fundamental elements. The term was first introduced to refer to targets of uniform resource locators (URLs), but its definition has been further extended to include the referent of any uniform resource identifier (RFC 3986), or internationalized resource identifier (RFC 3987). In the Semantic Web, abstract resources and their semantic properties are described using the family of languages based on Resource Description Framework (RDF).
