# 5.1 Hello World

1.  Copy the Airlift framework directory and rename it to helloworld or any naming of your choice.
2.  Open the src/doc/app.dic file.  Remove the existing text and paste the following:

         package example
         
         A Greeting
         can be viewed or collected or created or updated by all

4.  Create a GET.js handler for registration in war/WEB-INF/classes/handler/greeting.  Insert the following code:

        exports.handle = function(_web)
        {
            _web.setContent('Hello, World');
        }

5.  Go into the command line or terminal and enter `ant runserver`.

6.  Visit http://localhost:8080/a/greeting/id to view the posted web content.

# 5.2 Posting an Entity to the Datastore

1.  Copy the Airlift framework directory and rename it to example01 or any naming of your choice.
2.  Open the src/doc/app.dic file.  The example text included in the file describes four resources: a person, an order, an order line item, and a product.
3.  Let's add a resource to allow a person to register, or create an account for a web app.  This resource shall be called a registration.  Add the following text to the bottom of the app.dic file.


        A Registration
        has a full name
        has an email address
        has a mobile phone number which is not required
        has a "password"


4.  Create a POST.js handler for registration in war/WEB-INF/classes/handler/registration.  Insert the following code:

        exports.handle = function(_web)
        {
            require('airlift/rest/post').post(_web);
        };

    To get a deeper understanding of what this line of code does, one may look through the [source code](https://github.com/LucidTechnics/Airlift/blob/airlift_2.0_development/src/script/javascript/airlift/rest/post.js). It checks for any validations errors, and if there are none, the resource and each of its attributes are posted to Google App Engine's datastore.

5.  Go into the command line or terminal and enter `ant runserver`.

6.  Visit http://localhost:8080/_ah/admin to view Google App Engine's Datastore Viewer.  As nothing as been posted yet, it should be empty.

7.  Use curl to send a POST request to the web server.  Enter the following into the command line: 

        curl -X POST --data "fullName=Zombie_Panda&mobilePhoneNumber=5555555555&password=crun
        chy789&emailAddress=ilikebrainz@zmail.com" http://localhost:8080/a/registration

8.  The posted data is now viewable on the Datastore.
