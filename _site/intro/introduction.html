<h1 id='airlift_api_documentation'>Airlift API Documentation</h1>

<p>Airlift is an open web framework for building restful web applications using functional JavaScript on Google App Engine.</p>
<br />
<p>Users new to Airlift should check out the <a href='../manual'>manual</a> to get started. This API should help to clarify functions and assist the user as he writes his applications. The Airlift API provides method signatures, descriptions, working code examples and more for each available function in Airlift.</p>

<p>Color coded labels denote the stability of the function and tells in which version the function was added. The stability index is given as follows:</p>
<br /><table>
  <tr>
    <td width='100' height='50'> <label class='new'>Added in 2.0</label> </td>
    <td> <strong> Experimental: </strong> This function is newly released. 
         It may be changed or removed in the future. Feedback on this function 
         would be greatly appreciated. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width='100' height='50'> <label class='stable'>Added in 2.0</label> </td>
    <td> <strong> Stable: </strong> This is a fully supported and robustly
         tested function. Future versions of Airlift will strive to maintain 
         backwards compatibility. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width='100' height='50'> <label class='unstable'>Added in 2.0</label> </td>
    <td> <strong> Unstable: </strong> This function may still be subject to revisions. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width='100' height='50'> <label class='deprecated'>Added in 2.0</label> </td>
    <td> <strong> Deprecated: </strong> This function will be removed in future
         versions of Airlift. Backwards compatibility should not be expected.
         Avoiding futher usage is highly recommended. </td>
  </tr>
